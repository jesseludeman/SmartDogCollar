# SmartDogCollar
A project created for SIT210 - Embedded Systems Development for Deakin University. A C++ program that directly interfaces with a connected GPS that uses the gpsd program on a Raspberry Pi.

The program was originally programmed using Python, however as the program needs to perform as quickly as possible, I decided to move it to C++.
